# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture and design decisions behind the Multi-Client Server. The server is designed to handle multiple concurrent client connections using a thread pool and a producer-consumer model. This ensures scalability, efficiency, and resource management while providing a robust solution for handling high loads.

## 1. Key Components

The core server logic is responsible for initializing the server, setting up network connections, and managing the lifecycle of the server. This component includes:

    <summary>Socket Management</summary>

- [1. Responsible for creating and binding the server socket to a specific IP address and port.]()
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Listening for Connections</summary>

- [1. The server listens for incoming client connections and forwards them for processing.]()

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (2. Thread Pool)

[//]: # (   To handle multiple client connections concurrently, the server employs a thread pool. This is a collection of worker threads that are pre-allocated and reused to handle incoming tasks. The main goal is to avoid the overhead of constantly creating and destroying threads, which can be inefficient. The thread pool:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Initializes a fixed number of worker threads.)

[//]: # (Each thread waits for tasks to process from a shared task queue.)

[//]: # (Once a task &#40;client connection&#41; is completed, the thread returns to the pool, ready to handle new tasks.)

[//]: # (3. Producer-Consumer Model)

[//]: # (   The producer-consumer model is used to manage the flow of client connections. In this model:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Producers: New client connections are accepted by the server and placed in a connection queue. Each connection is considered a task that needs to be processed.)

[//]: # (Consumers: Worker threads &#40;from the thread pool&#41; pull tasks &#40;connections&#41; from the queue and handle them. After processing, they return to the pool to wait for new tasks.)

[//]: # (This model ensures that the server can handle a large number of incoming connections efficiently by decoupling the connection acceptance and processing stages.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (4. Modular Design)

[//]: # (   The server is organized into several distinct modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the server's functionality:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Server Module: Contains the main server logic, including socket management and connection acceptance.)

[//]: # (Client Handler Module: Responsible for processing client requests and sending responses back to clients.)

[//]: # (Thread Pool Module: Manages worker threads and the task queue.)

[//]: # (Queue Module: Manages the connection queue, providing synchronization mechanisms to ensure safe access by multiple threads.)

[//]: # (Utility Module: Contains common utility functions like error handling, logging, and configuration management.)

[//]: # (5. Communication Flow)

[//]: # (   The server listens for incoming client connections.)

[//]: # (   A new connection request is placed into the connection queue &#40;producer step&#41;.)

[//]: # (   One of the available worker threads from the thread pool picks up the connection from the queue and processes it &#40;consumer step&#41;.)

[//]: # (   Once the task is completed, the worker thread returns to the pool to handle the next task.)

[//]: # (6. Configuration and Scalability)

[//]: # (   The server is highly configurable. Key parameters like the number of worker threads, connection timeouts, and other server settings are defined in the configuration file &#40;config.h&#41;.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The thread pool size and queue behavior can be easily adjusted, making the system scalable to handle more clients as needed. Increasing the number of threads or optimizing the task queue can significantly improve the server's ability to handle high loads.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (7. Error Handling and Logging)

[//]: # (   The server includes a robust error-handling mechanism that ensures any issues are logged and the server can recover gracefully. The utils module provides logging functions to track server activity and errors, making it easier to debug and maintain the system.)
